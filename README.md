To get 13,500 V-Bucks for free in Fortnite Battle Royale, players often look for redeem codes and special promotions offered by Epic Games. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how you can potentially earn V-Bucks and access free rewards:

### How to Get Free V-Bucks

1. **Redeem Codes**: Epic Games occasionally releases redeem codes that can unlock V-Bucks and other in-game items. For December 2024, there are several active codes you can try, including:
   - **BANANNANANANA**: This code unlocks the "Nanner Ringer" emote.
   - Other codes may also provide rewards, but they often have limited availability and can expire quickly [[1]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fortnite-free-13500-code-lists-2024-get-newest-epic-9tyjc).

2. **Daily Quests**: In Fortnite's Save the World mode, players can complete daily quests to earn V-Bucks. Each daily quest can reward you with around 50 V-Bucks, and there are additional opportunities through timed missions and main questlines [[2]](https://freethevbucks.com/).

3. **Login Rewards**: Occasionally, players can earn V-Bucks through daily login rewards, which can include significant amounts on specific days [[2]](https://freethevbucks.com/).

4. **Events and Challenges**: Participating in special events or completing challenges can also yield V-Bucks as rewards. Keep an eye on Fortnite's seasonal events for these opportunities [[2]](https://freethevbucks.com/).

### Important Notes

- **Beware of Scams**: Be cautious of websites or offers claiming to provide free V-Bucks in exchange for personal information or completing surveys. These are often scams designed to steal your account information [[2]](https://freethevbucks.com/).
- **Limited Codes**: Remember that redeem codes are not permanent and can be used only a limited number of times. Always check for the latest codes and redeem them quickly [[1]](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/fortnite-free-13500-code-lists-2024-get-newest-epic-9tyjc).

By utilizing these methods, you can maximize your chances of accumulating V-Bucks without spending real money.
